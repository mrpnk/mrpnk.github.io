                You arrive on a small island and after some time of confusing conversation you realize that each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.
                Knights are bound to the code of honour and they say nothing but the truth. Knaves however are malicious and every sentence the say is a lie.
                Unfortunately their appearence allows no conclusion about their nature.
                When you wander around the island you meet small groups of locals. Can you find out what they are?

                After a group of Knights and Knaves set up their tents, Thomas (the best cook among them) started
                cooking at the campfire while all the others settle in a circle around the fire,
                watching him.
                He noticed that everyone in the circle seemed to know the two people next to him.
                Thomas did not know anyone except his good friend Richard.
                To get to know the round a little more he asked a person in the circle, "You and the two,
                who sit next to you: is there an odd number of knaves in this small set?"
                The person answered. Thomas asked another randomly chosen person and received the same
                answer. Whoever he asked, he kept getting this answer. Finally, after he had
                asked everybody else, he turned the same question to Richard. Surprisingly his answer was different from all the others.
                Thomas paused for a moment and then asked Richard, "Are you sitting between two knights?", whereupon
                Richard replied his answer. Thomas concluded "Then there are more knaves present than knights."

                Let <em>n</em> be the number of people present. How many are Knights resp. Knaves, and
                what are Thomas and Richard?
